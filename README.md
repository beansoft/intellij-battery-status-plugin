    Battery Status
</h1>

<p align="center">
    IntelliJ IDEA (and other JetBrains products) plugin that displays battery status in the Status Bar.
</p>

Usage:

* Windows: plugin should work as it.
* Linux: you must be able to invoke `acpi -i`. Be sure ACPI is installed: on Debian or Ubuntu, type `sudo apt install acpi`.
* MacOS: plugin should work as it. You must be able to invoke `pmset -g batt`.

Plugin is currently tested on <b>Windows 10</b> and <b>Ubuntu 18.04</b> LTS with both JBR (JetBrains JRE) 8 and 11, on IntelliJ 2017.3 and better.

Battery status is updated every 20 seconds.
